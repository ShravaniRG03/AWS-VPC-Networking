1. **[Building a VPC](./1%20-%20Building%20a%20VPC.pdf)**
   - Learn how to create a custom Virtual Private Cloud from scratch.
   - Covers CIDR blocks, subnets, and VPC setup fundamentals.

2. **[VPC Traffic Flow & Security](./2%20-%20VPC%20Traffic%20Flow%20%26%20Security.pdf)**
   - Dive into routing tables, security groups, and network ACLs.
   - Understand how traffic moves within your VPC and how to secure it.

3. **[Creating a Private Subnet](./3%20-%20Creating%20a%20Private%20Subnet.pdf)**
   - Set up private subnets for isolating internal resources.
   - Focused on security and restricting direct internet access.
   
4. **[Launching VPC Resources](./4%20-%20Launching%20VPC%20Resources.pdf)**
   - Deploy EC2 instances into your VPC, and configure roles, keys, and access.

5. **[Testing VPC Connectivity](./5%20-%20Testing%20VPC%20Connectivity.pdf)**
   - Test connectivity across public and private subnets using ping, SSH, and other tools.

6. **[VPC Peering](./6%20-%20VPC%20Peering.pdf)**
   - Learn how to connect two VPCs securely using peering connections.
